# AscII2Amos
Project to convert AscII files into AMOS professionals .AMOS files. The aim for this project is high compatibility.

Right now this program creates AMOS bombs, you can load .AMOS files in AMOSPro, but it likely AMOSPro will crash if you try to run programs, it currently not know, what course of this.

The program is producing the same tokens as Amos Pro does, it is possible however that some of special commands that has extra data, might have wrong extra data.

The next stage in development of this program is to investigate what data should be.
Unless you like to help me solve the puzzle you should not use this tool.
